# Data Format Specifications

## General File Format

### Character-delimited Text Files

All data used and generated by modules is stored in character-delimited text files. Each module must support the following delimiters:

1. Comma (`,`)
2. Tab (`\t`)
3. Space (`\s`)

## Graph Data Formats

### Edgelist Format

An edgelist is a character-delimited text file containing at least two columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| source | Node ID representing the source of an edge (in directed graphs) or one endpoint (in undirected graphs) |
| target | Node ID representing the target of an edge (in directed graphs) or the other endpoint (in undirected graphs) |

**Important notes:**
- Each (source, target) pair **uniquely** identifies an edge in the graph
- By default, parallel edges (duplicate source-target pairs) are removed from the graph
- For undirected graphs, the order of source and target is not significant

#### Additional Edge Attributes
Additional columns beyond source and target may be included to represent edge attributes:
- To represent weighted graph, use "weight" column to denote edge weight
- TBD: other custom attributes

#### Ordering
"source" and "target" should be the first two columns, no matter if there are any additional attributes. The columns should be in "source,target" order.

### Nodelist Format

A nodelist is a character-delimited text file containing at least one column:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| node_id | Value that **uniquely** identifies a node within a specific graph |

#### Additional Node Attributes
Additional columns may be included to represent node attributes such as:
- type
- fitness
- other custom attributes

#### Ordering
The "node_id" column should be the first column, no matter if there are any additional attributes.

## Clustering Data Format

### Cluster Membership Format

A cluster membership file is a character-delimited text file containing at least two columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| node_id | Value that **uniquely** identifies a node in the graph |
| cluster_id | Value that **uniquely** identifies a cluster/community |

A row with (node_id = i, cluster_id = j) indicates that node i belongs to cluster j.

#### Ordering
The columns should be in "node_id,cluster_id" order.
